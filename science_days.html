<P><b>Because in science, sometimes you just have to laugh at the end of a long day:</b>

<P>

<P>"Basic research is like shooting an arrow into the air and, where it lands, painting a target."
<br>- Homer Burton Adkins (1892-1949, American organic chemist)

<P>"I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you looked at it the right way, did not become still more complicated."
<br>- Paul Alderson 

<P>"Your theory is crazy...but it's not crazy enough to be true."
<br>- Neils Bohr

<P>"In science one tries to tell people something that no one ever knew before, in such a way that it is understood by everyone. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite."
<br>- Paul Dirac


<P>"Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several thousand
things that won't work."
<br>- Thomas Edison (1847-1931)

<P>"A scientist is a mimosa when he himself has made a mistake, and a roaring
lion when he discovers a mistake of others."
<br>- Albert Einstein

<P>"Every honest researcher I know admits he's just a professional amateur. 
He's doing whatever he's doing for the first time. That makes him an 
amateur. He has sense enough to know that he's going to have a lot of 
trouble, so that makes him a professional."
<br>- Charles Franklin Kettering
